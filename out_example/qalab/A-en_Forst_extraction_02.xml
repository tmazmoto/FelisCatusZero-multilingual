The first half of the 20th century, in between the human race only 30 years, experienced a world war over two degrees. The war transformed the fate of countless people, the devastation was left a deep scar in various parts of the world. The result of the two wars, the direction of the subsequent history of the various regions decisive, it is no exaggeration to say has been a big influence factor the history of people, and until today. 20 century early 1901, which opened the curtain, I finished life of British Queen Victoria was over the reign 60 Toshi-yo. The funeral has attended from most of the royal family of Europe, yet by many of relatives or in-laws relationship, it had been connected to the queen. Prestige of Queen Victoria, as indicated by the word Pax Britannica, was to symbolize the mighty forces of the British Empire that has reigned on top of the world order in the 19th century. Then within just a '20 less than, fighting countries is divided down the middle of the camp, yet As a result, it is to become a thing to turn off the beginning Austria, figure major dynasty, such as Russia and Germany, who was expected I wonder. However, the beginning of the 20th century, mainly in Europe, while the various regions of the world Yuku are linked by a close relationship, deep cracks that occur there was also the era has come to reveal. Unified completion of the German Empire, which was against the background of the Prussian forces, coupled with the remarkable development of the industry, was intended to shake the British position, which stood on the balance of power of the European powers. Powers, while exploring each other of new alliances, and compete with and enhance the military, with the aim of ensuring the exclusive market for infrastructure enhancements and economic expansion of the country's industry, went embarked on colonial acquisition. As seen in the previous chapter, in Europe, it was while born two camps to conflict that Tripartite Pact and the Triple Entente. Such movement criticized by imperialism a four, also movement of socialism complaining of international solidarity and anti-war workers of countries had been organized. For Socialists, the interests of the industry by the development of capitalism what, was something that produces conflict of national or ethnic. However, conflict of countries to stimulate the national consciousness of the people, xenophobia of ethnocentric has often driven a lot of people in frenzy. Mainly in Germany, 19th century nationalism, the direction of national formation as a community of ethnic groups that share a language and culture, has become a thing of strengthening. The Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Ottoman Empire, as a legacy of the great powers that troubled the inner diverse ethnic groups, was shaken to the movement of the various ethnic groups for ejecting. Especially in the Balkans, by interventions such as various ethnic independence and Russia multiplied in it, it showed a very unstable aspects. Among the colonial competition of European powers becomes violently, in various places resistance to expansion of powers has occurred in a variety. Sudan and Mahdi movement that happened at the end of the 19th century, century Boxer Rebellion in China at the turn of the shows the various aspects of the people's resistance. These developments, as well as to shake the established authority of each region, was supposed to be to explored the way of the new order to the people. Until where the system such as the dynasty domination had been established in its own way, the first in many cases strengthening of the framework or restructuring was required. However, in many cases, the old regime is brittle against the advance of the European forces, and collapsed to remain not be shown sufficient resistance, or deprived of their rights and interests in the activities of the active industrial and capital of Europe, Kumiko in the world I went rare. The end of the 19th century, not only in Europe of industrial technology, movement to Toriireyo thought and institutions, the constitutional system, particularly linking the nation and the people by the Constitution and the Congress, as well as some reformers, young intellectuals of those countries It had come to capture widely, and the like. Youth in the Ottoman Empire Turkey, Sun Yat-sen these activities in China, was intended to be representative of such new generation. But, in the Ottoman Empire and the Qing Dynasty and the European countries face a vast area of ​​heterogeneous China, or will of the nations and peoples of the framework is where the demand. After the Young Turk revolution, strengthened gradually Turkish nationalism in the Ottoman Empire, Empire went fraught with crisis of dismantling. China's Sun Yat-sen, also by warlords defending local authority after the Xinhai Revolution, had to experience the long civil war. National, ethnic formation, in the non-European world, was not in any way be self-evident. This early 20th century, Japan had already realized the imperial constitutional framework, are troops in Beijing along with the Western countries in the Boxer Rebellion, it was beginning to enter the corner of powers. 1902 of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance was so to speak a clear ranks of the imperialist countries. Soon, Japan by fart the Russo-Japanese War, Yuku proceed to the annexation of Korea. </PASSAGE>
